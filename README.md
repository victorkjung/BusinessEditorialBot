# BusinessEditorialBot

The Business Editorial Bot App is a Streamlit application that leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model to generate summaries of business articles. You can paste the URL of an article, select the desired tone (e.g., professional, witty, engaging, or casual), and the app will produce a summarised version of the article in the chosen tone.

The output can be downloaded as a .docx file for further use.

After launching the app, paste the URL of the business article in the 'Enter the URL' field, select the desired tone of the article summary, then click 'Generate'. You will then need to enter your OpenAI API key. After the summary is generated, review and edit the draft if needed before clicking 'Publish' to generate the final version. You can then download the generated summary as a .docx file.

Running on GPT 3.5; the queries are less than a penny a request. This is very economical solution to the paying for other SAAS programs as you are still experimenting and exploring the world of python, its libraries like Streamlit, pandas, LLM language models, and ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) the artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI.
